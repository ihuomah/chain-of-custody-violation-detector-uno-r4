# Chain-of-Custody Violation Detection System (CoC-VDS)

## Summary
This project is a cyber-physical prototype built on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi to detect and record **chain-of-custody violations** during supply-chain hardware delivery
(Factory → Courier → Data Center).

Unlike basic tamper detection, the system focuses on **custody rules**:

- who is authorized to handle the package
- when custody transfers are allowed
- whether movement/opening occurred outside authorized custody windows

## Current status
- Phase 1 complete: Hardware bring-up + sensor calibration verified
- Phase 2: Custody model and violation rules defined.
This included identifying system roles, custody states, allowed transitions,
and explicit violation conditions for a supply-chain delivery scenario
(Factory → Courier → Data Center).
- Phase 3: Custody state machine implementation


## Core sensors
- RFID (MFRC522): custodian identity
- IMU (GY-87): handling/movement detection
- LDR (photoresistor): seal breach/light exposure
- OLED: on-device audit status display
