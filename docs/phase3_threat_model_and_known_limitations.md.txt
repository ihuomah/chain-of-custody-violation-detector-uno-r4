## Threat Model & Known Limitations (Phase 3)

Phase 3 is intentionally scoped to enforce **process integrity after custody initiation**.
The following assumptions and limitations are explicit and deliberate.

---

### 1. Calibration Trust Assumption
Sensor thresholds are automatically calibrated at boot based on the ambient environment.

Assumption:
- Calibration is performed by a trusted administrator
- The enclosure is closed
- The environment is reasonably controlled

Limitation:
- If calibration occurs in a bright or noisy environment, thresholds may be inflated
- Elevated thresholds could reduce sensitivity to later violations

This represents a **calibration trust boundary**, not a logic flaw.

Mitigation:
- Addressed in Phase 4 via explicit arming, calibration locking, sanity bounds, and audit logging.

---

### 2. Threshold Visibility & Side-Channel Leakage
During Phase 3, live sensor readings and derived thresholds are displayed on the OLED for debugging and validation.

Limitation:
- Threshold values and real-time readings are observable
- An attacker could infer enforcement sensitivity and adapt behavior

This exposure is intentional in Phase 3 to:
- validate calibration correctness
- tune thresholds
- observe system behavior

Mitigation:
- Phase 4 introduces stealth UI and restricted debug modes.

---

### 3. Pre-Seal Handling (No Custody Yet)
Before the WHITE tag seals the asset, the system is in `UNINITIALIZED`.

Limitation:
- Movement or removal of the device before sealing does not trigger a violation
- No chain-of-custody claim exists prior to sealing

This mirrors real-world custody models:
- Evidence and packages are not protected until formally sealed

Mitigation:
- Phase 4 introduces pre-seal anomaly tracking and seal-time consistency checks.

---

### 4. Insider or Bypass Scenarios
Phase 3 treats RFID credentials as possession-based trust tokens.

Limitation:
- Card cloning, theft, or insider misuse is not detected
- Identity assurance is out of scope for this phase

Mitigation:
- Phase 4 adds MFA, multi-party authorization, and forensic correlation.

---

### 5. Enforcement Without Attribution
Phase 3 enforces rules and detects violations but does not persist custody history.

Limitation:
- Violations are detected in real time but not reconstructed after power loss

Mitigation:
- Phase 4 introduces append-only, tamper-evident logging.

---

### Summary
Phase 3 establishes a correct and enforceable custody model **once custody begins**.

Security hardening, stealth, and forensic attribution are intentionally deferred to Phase 4 to preserve clean separation of concerns.
