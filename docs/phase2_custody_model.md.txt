# Phase 2 — Custody Model & Rules

## Scenario
Supply-chain custody for hardware delivery (factory → courier → data center).

## Strict rules
- **A: Any light exposure = compromised**
- **B: Violation is one-way (tamper-evident)**

## Roles
- Admin/Sealer (factory)
- Handler (courier)
- Receiver (data center)

## States
UNINITIALIZED → SEALED_IDLE → IN_CUSTODY → TRANSFER_WINDOW → (VIOLATION_LOCK | RECEIVED_FINAL)

## Custody violations
- Motion in SEALED_IDLE (unauthorised handling)
- Any light exposure after seal (seal breach)
- Transfer window timeout
- Excessive unknown RFID attempts
